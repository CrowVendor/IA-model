    "10/30: Started working on implememting an IA model. Read through the PDP handbook to get a sense of how it works. Conclusion: three levels, each composed of units for having and not having certain features, sometimes organized into sets (ie on feature level). Units have excitory or inhibitory effects on each other, varying between levels. Began coding, establishing a unit class and hardcoding in the features per letter. Wrangled github."

Added in some more factors for # cycles etc. Found/made database of ~1000 english words. Still need to add more user choice in input, and possibly more forms of output. Considering: deciding which words to look at by some other factor, possibly change in activation? mclelland/rumelhart 1998 has an intergral?; possibly have a check for how many cycles to reach certain activation for the correct word, use as response time to compare to experimental data"
